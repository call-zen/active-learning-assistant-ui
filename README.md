# 📊 Stack AI Smart Feedback Interface for Batch Processing

> A no-code, agentic AI enhancement for batch processing pipelines, designed to help users debug, iterate, and improve LLM outputs with smart, contextual feedback suggestions.

🔗 **Live Prototype**: [https://active-learning-assistant-ui.lovable.app/](https://active-learning-assistant-ui.lovable.app/)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project introduces a **smart LLM-powered feedback system** into Stack AI's batch processing UI. The goal is to transform Stack from a passive agent-execution tool into an **active assistant** that continuously guides users toward better outcomes by analyzing prompt structure, intermediate results, and final outputs.

This interface adds a **"User Feedback" column** that shows targeted, LLM-generated suggestions for improving each row of batch output—drastically reducing time spent debugging failed generations or misaligned results.

## 🎯 Why We're Building This

Stack AI is rapidly becoming the go-to no-code platform for building AI-powered workflows. However, enterprise users often face three friction points:

1. **Unclear output errors** – When LLMs fail silently or perform poorly, users have little insight into what went wrong.
2. **Slow iteration cycles** – Without guided suggestions, improving prompt quality is manual and time-consuming.
3. **Low workflow confidence** – Lack of clarity makes users hesitant to scale workflows or rely on automation.

To address these challenges, this feature:

- **Automates prompt debugging** using pipeline-wide LLM context.
- **Surfaces smart improvement suggestions** directly in the UI.
- **Improves long-term stickiness** by learning from user corrections and generating smarter default behaviors.

## 🧱 System Architecture

This project is built as a modular, agentic system with two core microservices and an integrated frontend display:

### 1. 🧩 Pipeline Context Generator (PCG)
- Python microservice that captures:
  - User prompts
  - Intermediate agent results
  - Final outputs
  - Metadata (e.g. UserID, BatchRunID)
- Structures all this data and sends a single JSON API request to the feedback engine.

### 2. 🧠 LLM Feedback Engine
- Python service that:
  - Ingests pipeline context
  - Runs an LLM agent chain to generate feedback
  - Categorizes issues (e.g. “Missing key data”, “Incorrect extraction”)
  - Returns a structured JSON payload:
    ```json
    {
      "issue": "Missing key data",
      "reason": "Missing document",
      "suggested_fix": "Add annual earnings slides focused on macroeconomic data and purchase information."
    }
    ```

### 3. 🗃️ Context Data Store
- Tracks:
  - Pipeline history
  - User corrections
  - Model versions
  - Feedback logs with timestamps for future analytics

### 4. 💻 Feedback Display in UI
- React-based table UI that includes:
  - New **“User Feedback” column**
  - Dropdowns for issue types
  - Clickable "Suggested Fix" text
  - Inline tagging/editing by users

## 📈 Feature Implementation Plan

### ✅ 1. Feedback Collection
- Capture inline edits, issue tags, and row-specific user corrections.
- Log with full metadata (model, module, timestamp, etc.).
- Track downstream changes in future batches to correlate impact of fixes.

### 🤖 2. LLM Suggestions
- Generate prompt refinement ideas based on output issues across the batch.
- Recommend better document inputs/contextual sources.
- Continuously improve based on recurring failure patterns.

### 🔁 3. Iterative Platform Improvements
- Aggregate correction data to optimize default agentic flows.
- Power dashboards with common issues across users.
- Score workflows/prompts based on correction frequency.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> A user uploads several financial reports for automated summarization.
> Some rows fail due to vague prompts or missing documents.
> The LLM Feedback Engine detects this, tags those rows with “Missing key data”, and suggests “Add annual earnings slides”.

The user instantly knows what to fix—without needing to guess or troubleshoot manually.
